            <p class="testimonials-para">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
            in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
            <p class="testimonials-sub">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of
                my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
                startup. ”</p>

            <p class="testimonials-para">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them
                 and learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
            <p class="testimonials-sub">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The
                program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
                developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community
                of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

            <p class="testimonials-para-Kira">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
            <p class="testimonials-sub-Kira">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs
                who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
                hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took
                my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during
                interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer
                after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
